# Chess Pieces Detection and Classification

## Overview

This project was developed for the **Signal, Image, and Video** course at the *UniversitÃ  di Trento*.

It implements a handcrafted object detection and classification pipeline for chess pieces, and compares its performance with a deep learning-based approach.

In this repository, you'll find the source code and a Jupyter notebook (`demo.ipynb`) presenting the experimental results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Roboflow:

ðŸ”— [Chess Full Dataset](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/chess-full)

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the notebook**

   Execute the Jupyter notebook to explore the detection and classification experiments:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
   ```

   Follow the instructions in the notebook to see detailed experimental results.
